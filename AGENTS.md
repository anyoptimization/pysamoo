# AGENTS.md — working in pysamoo

**pysamoo** is driven by [pyclawd](https://github.com/julian/pyclawd), a
config-driven Python dev-task CLI: one file (`.pyclawd/config.py`) describes the
project and `pyclawd <verb>` is the single contract for every task — humans and AI
agents drive it the same way.

This file is the **operational contract** — the commands, the boundaries, the
non-negotiables. It is always in your context, so follow it. For the *why* behind
the rules — the testing taxonomy, typing, packaging, and docstring doctrine, with
examples — invoke the **`pyclawd` skill** (Claude Code; installed user-scope and
shared across every pyclawd project). In short: **AGENTS.md is what to run; the
skill is how to write good code.**

## Critical rule — how to run Python

**ALWAYS run Python through `pyclawd python`. NEVER call bare `python` / `python -c`.**

```bash
pyclawd python script.py          # run a script
pyclawd python -m pytest ...       # run a module
pyclawd python -c "import pysamoo" # quick check
```

`pyclawd python` runs in the project's configured env (the `conda_env` in
`.pyclawd/config.py`, or whatever env pyclawd is installed into) with the repo
root on `PYTHONPATH`. Bare `python` misses the env and the in-tree source.

## Commands — quick reference

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Resolved config (what each command runs) | `pyclawd config` |
| Health-check the dev env | `pyclawd doctor` |
| Run Python in the env | `pyclawd python <file>` · `-m <mod>` · `-c <code>` |
| Fast smoke (<30s, no integration) | `pyclawd test fast` |
| Default gate (no slow) | `pyclawd test run` |
| Full suite (incl. slow) | `pyclawd test all` |
| Select tests | `pyclawd test -k <kw>` · `pyclawd test tests/path::node` |
| Fix-loop | `pyclawd test failures` → `pyclawd test fix` → `pyclawd test run` |
| Coverage | `pyclawd coverage [--check] [--html]` |
| Prove behavior unchanged | `pyclawd golden [-k EXPR]` · `golden update [-k EXPR]` · `status` · `prune` · `vendor <file>` |
| Lint / autofix | `pyclawd lint` · `pyclawd lint --fix` · `pyclawd lint <file...>` |
| Format / check | `pyclawd format` · `pyclawd format --check` · `pyclawd format <file...>` |
| Type-check | `pyclawd typecheck` · `pyclawd typecheck <file...>` |
| **Aggregate quality gate** | `pyclawd check` · `--fix` · `--skip <verb>` · `--fail-fast` · `pyclawd check <file...>` |
| Build / dist / clean | `pyclawd compile` · `pyclawd dist` · `pyclawd clean [--ext]` |
| Docs (if configured) | `pyclawd docs build\|run\|render\|serve\|status\|failures\|exec <page>` |
| Code map (file → description) | `pyclawd ls [DIR]` · `pyclawd ls --missing` |
| Manage agent skills | `pyclawd skills list` · `pyclawd skills install` |
| Version + config drift | `pyclawd version` · `pyclawd version --json` |
| What changed (since config) | `pyclawd changelog [--since V] [--full]` |
| Repo root | `pyclawd root` |

Run `pyclawd config` first — it shows the exact command every verb resolves to and
the `PYCLAWD_*` override knobs (`PYCLAWD_CONFIG`, `PYCLAWD_DISCOVERY`,
`PYCLAWD_PYTHON`, `PYCLAWD_WORK_DIR`). To use pyclawd **without committing** a
`.pyclawd/` folder, set `PYCLAWD_DISCOVERY=".local/.pyclawd:.pyclawd"` (relative →
safe globally) and keep a gitignored `<repo>/.local/.pyclawd/config.py`.
`pyclawd check` runs all quality steps (format-check
→ lint → typecheck) **regardless of individual failures**, streaming output inline,
then runs **test** only if quality passed. Use `--skip <verb>` (repeatable) to omit
a step, `--fail-fast` to stop at the first failure, `--fix` to apply format+lint
autofixes in place, and `--log` to also write each step's output to a file (CI
artifacts). Build/dist/clean and docs commands only do real work when the project
configures them; otherwise they degrade gracefully (exit 2 = not configured).

## Test tiers

| Tier | Marker filter | When |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | `not slow and not integration` | After every edit — <30s smoke |
| `run` (default) | `not slow` | Before opening a PR |
| `all` | _(no filter)_ | Nightly / pre-release |

Mark slow tests `@pytest.mark.slow`, tests needing live services
`@pytest.mark.integration`. Unmarked tests run in every tier — never mark a test
`fast`. The fix-loop and failure taxonomy live in the `pyclawd` skill's `references/tests.md`.

## Behavior oracle (golden)

`pyclawd check` proves code **clean** (format/lint/typecheck/test); it cannot prove
behavior **unchanged** — a clean edit can still move a number. `pyclawd golden`
closes that gap: it compares observable outputs against **committed** baselines and
fails on drift (tolerance is the gate; the stored hash is only a fast path, so
baselines survive cross-platform float jitter; values are inline so `git diff` shows
`0.925 → 0.522`). Workflow: **agents compare, humans bless** — `pyclawd golden`
gates, `pyclawd golden update [-k EXPR]` records an *intended* change (merges, never
wipes others), then a human reviews the baseline `git diff` and commits; `status`
lists snapshots, `prune` drops orphaned ones. Write a golden test by tagging it
`@pytest.mark.golden` and **`return`ing the value** to snapshot — the pytest plugin
captures it (there is no fixture). It works **standalone in a bare-pytest repo with
zero pyclawd references**; `pyclawd golden` is the optional CLI wrapper (`GoldenConfig`
drives it; unset → exit 2). For zero pyclawd dependency, `pyclawd golden vendor <file>`
copies the plugin into one self-contained file. golden is a **separate tier** —
exclude it from the unit tiers (`"default": "not slow and not golden"`) and run it as
its own gate. Full doctrine in the **`pyclawd-golden`** skill.

## Architecture — generic core + per-project config

pyclawd ships a project-agnostic command layer. Everything project-specific lives
in **`.pyclawd/config.py`** — a module-level `project = Project(...)` (from
`pyclawd import Project`). The directory containing `.pyclawd/` **is** the repo
root. The `Project` model groups config: `QualityConfig` (lint/format/typecheck),
`TestConfig` (tests dir + tier markers), `DocsConfig` (or `None`), `DoctorConfig`
(deps/binaries to probe). Read `.pyclawd/config.py` before assuming how this
project is wired — it is the single source of truth for env, paths, and checks.

**Every module opens with a one-line docstring** — the `descriptions` step of
`pyclawd check` enforces this for `DescriptionConfig`-included files; `pyclawd ls
--missing` is the broader exploratory view of all files lacking one. **Docstrings use Google style, no types** (`Args:` / `Returns:`
/ `Raises:` with plain descriptions — annotations carry the types). `pyclawd lint`
checks docstring style via ruff's `D` rules (Google convention) — write `Args:`/
`Returns:`, not NumPy `Parameters`/`----------`. The `pyclawd` skill has examples
and shows how to change the convention when adopting an existing repo.

## Boundaries

### Always
- Run code via `pyclawd python` — never bare `python`.
- Run `pyclawd doctor` first when the env looks off or tests fail to import.
- **Run `pyclawd check` before declaring work done** or opening a PR.
- Fix the **cause** of a failing test, not the assertion — tolerances for floats,
  pinned seeds for stochastic tests.
- Match existing patterns; read `.pyclawd/config.py` before changing wiring.

### Ask first
- Destructive cleans (`pyclawd clean --ext`), committing, pushing, opening PRs.
- Changing `.pyclawd/config.py`, dependencies, or the public API surface.

### Never
- Never call bare `python`/`pip` outside the project env.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.
- Never weaken or delete a test to make a suite pass.
- Never leave the tree with a failing `pyclawd check`.
- Never use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks — fix the cause.
- Never wire `pyclawd golden update` into an autonomous loop — agents compare,
  humans bless.

## How you know you're done

- `pyclawd check` is green (format-check, lint, typecheck, descriptions, and tests
  all ✓). The `descriptions` step is the enforced gate — it passes when every
  `DescriptionConfig`-included file (default `.py`/`.pyx`) has a one-line
  description.
- `pyclawd doctor` exits 0 — no FAILs.
- Behavior is verified by tests, not just by inspection.

`pyclawd ls --missing` is the broader **exploratory** view — it lists every repo
file lacking a one-liner, including templates/Markdown the `descriptions` gate
ignores, so it may be non-empty even when `pyclawd check` is green.

**Going deeper.** This file is the contract. For the doctrine behind it, invoke the
Claude Code skills: **`pyclawd`** is the umbrella router — a lean overview plus
on-demand reference docs (`references/mental-model.md`, `references/tests.md`,
`references/quality.md`, `references/docs.md`, `references/packaging.md`) that carry
the testing, quality, docs, and packaging doctrine. Three focused standalone skills
sit alongside it: **`pyclawd-golden`** (the behavior oracle), **`pyclawd-doctor`**
(diagnose a broken env), and **`pyclawd-upgrade`** (migrate this project after pyclawd
itself is updated, when `pyclawd version` shows config drift). They are generic (not
specific to this repo) and update centrally when pyclawd is upgraded — which is exactly
why the deep doctrine lives there and not duplicated into this file.
